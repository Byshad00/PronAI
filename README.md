# PronAI — AI Pronunciation Coach 

PronAI is a lightweight front-end AI pronunciation coaching demo that helps learners practice English pronunciation through listening, speaking, and instant feedback.

This project focuses on **interactive pronunciation practice** using browser-based speech technologies, designed as a **demo/prototype** for educational and training purposes.

##  Features
- Step-by-step pronunciation practice (Listen → Speak → Feedback)
- Word & sentence practice modes
- Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced levels
- Accent selection (American / British)
- Speech speed control
- Instant pronunciation feedback
- Clean and interactive UI

---

##  How It Works
- Uses **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** to play the correct pronunciation
- Uses **Speech Recognition** to capture the user's voice
- Compares spoken input with the target text using text similarity
- Provides a score and feedback to guide improvement

>  **Note:**  
> This is a **demo/prototype**. The scoring mechanism is based on **text similarity**, not phoneme-level pronunciation analysis.
